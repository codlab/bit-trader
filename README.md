## About

### Forked edition

This software is made to enhance the trading experience. Test algorithms, order management and have fun !

It is meant to be safe by using (in this version) only "limit"-ed orders. Avoiding loss during buy/sell. But it doesn't check for invalid steps which could lead to sell giving less than what was used to buy the crypto/fiat pair. Maybe a TODO? Pull Request?

### Original

bit-trader is a simple bitcoin and altcoin trading bot / bot-platform for the exchange [Kraken](http://kraken.com).
It isn't affilated or related to Payward, Inc. (the company behind kraken), kraken was just the first exchange to be implemented.

The whole project is currently very alpha-ish but I have the base "micro-trades"-strategy already running on my account and it already produces some money.

Since the whole thing is work-in-progress, currently there is no getting started but developers familiar with nodejs should be able to start it easely.
